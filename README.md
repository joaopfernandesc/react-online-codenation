# react-online-codenation

Here you can check all the tasks I've accomplished while making Codenation's React Online Course, it was my first experience using React.

Every fold has its own README. But if you are looking for just a resume:

**nodejs-0**: Fibonacci series;

**nodejs-12**: Shopping cart;

**react-11**: Static webpage using only HTML and CSS (IMDB copy);

**react-12**: Static webpage using only HTML and CSS with mobile first and BEM (Instagram copy);

**react-13**: Nothing to see here (really, it's just an introduction to next week's task);

**react-14**: Contacts APP using React;

**react-15**: Nothing to see here (I mean it);

**react-16**: Instagram using React, showing stories, users, API, etc;

The final challenge was to build an e-commerce and you may check it here:
